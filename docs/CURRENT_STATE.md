# Current Project State

## Current Phase

- Phase: **5F — Falsification**
- Status: **ACTIVE — 5F.1 evaluation projection & blind-case foundation**
- Last updated: 2026-08-16
- Last completed implementation milestone: Phase 5E.4
- Last verified implementation commit: `1733485fdce630e4a3c32731c7dcbc62cbdebefb`
- Branch: `sentinel-x-phase1`

## Completed Capabilities

### Phase 0 — Engineering baseline
Typed package/runtime/config/EventBus/storage/CLI/quality/CI foundation.

### Phase 1 — Linux host observability
Host identity, CPU/load, memory, filesystem, disk I/O, network, and process observation/sampling.

### Phase 2 — systemd/journald evidence and correlation
Bounded service observation, journald reading/checkpoint continuity, exact/fallback correlation, live EventBus correlation bridge.

### Phase 3 — Fault Lab
Controlled Sentinel-owned systemd fixtures, two real fault modes, ground-truth windows, recovery verification, reproducible dataset artifacts.

### Phase 4 — Detection/evaluation/incidents
Conservative service detector, repeated controlled evaluation, incident lifecycle, live EventBus detection bridge, evidence characterization.

### Phase 5A–5E.4 — Dependency/propagation research reference
Dependency evidence/discovery/graph, temporal/coverage evidence, controlled pair experiments, live runner, synthesis, paired contrast, protocol provenance, protocol-bound live execution.

## Current Validation State

Last authoritative Fedora baseline for Phase 5E.4:

```text
140 Python files formatted
Ruff PASS
strict mypy: 74 source files PASS
unit tests: 1248 / 1248 PASS
GitHub Actions: 4 jobs green
repository clean after push
```

Canonical implementation baseline:

```text
1733485fdce630e4a3c32731c7dcbc62cbdebefb
phase5: add protocol-bound controlled live execution
```

Phase-5E.4 live proof observed:

```text
Requires -> affected_anomaly_observed (20 samples)
Wants    -> bounded_negative_evidence (20 samples)
paired profile -> requires_anomaly_wants_bounded_negative
same boot/backend binding verified
post-recovery verified
```

This is controlled/descriptive evidence, not a universal systemd causal claim.

## Partially Completed / Research-Only Capabilities

- Phase-5 dependency/propagation subsystem is not wired into normal CLI runtime reasoning.
- Evidence bundles/protocol records exist but a general trusted public replay path is incomplete.
- Controlled experiment evidence is narrow (single-host systemd fixture domain).
- Current evidence characterization is not probability calibration.

## Not Yet Implemented

- Phase-5F evaluation projections and corpus;
- deterministic comparison baselines for the falsification benchmark;
- external/blinded LLM evaluation process;
- reasoner output ClaimDraft runtime model;
- Claim Gate;
- Evidence-Carrying Diagnosis runtime artifact;
- topology–evidence divergence research corpus;
- cross-distro/systemd generalization;
- production privilege separation;
- production crash durability policy for all required state;
- production performance/SLO/soak validation;
- autonomous remediation.

## Current Architecture State

See `ARCHITECTURE.md`. Important fact: `src/sentinel_x/dependency/` is a frozen research subsystem and has no normal runtime consumer outside itself.

## Current API State

The package has large research symbol surfaces inherited from incremental development. Phase-5 dependency exports are intentionally retained until Full-vs-Minimal ablation can determine which machinery has measurable value.

Do not treat current public research exports as a commitment to future stable API.

## Current Integrations

- Linux native sources
- systemd/systemctl
- journald evidence path
- filesystem/JSONL persistence

No production LLM, OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, or external chaos integration exists.

## Current Blockers to Further Architecture Growth

1. structured evidence value vs RAW reasoning is unproven.
2. FULL Phase-5 complexity vs MINIMAL evidence is unproven.
3. current synthesis vs simple Graph+Time heuristic is unproven.
4. Phase-5F evaluation views/corpus must preserve blinding and the frozen preregistration.

## Current Temporary / Intentionally Retained Implementations

- Phase-5 identity/DTO/protocol hierarchy;
- 139 dependency exports;
- repeated validation logic in research models;
- root-level legacy baseline files;
- evidence characterization named `calibration` although it is not probabilistic calibration.

These are reduction candidates, not immediate refactor targets.

## Immediate Next Tasks

### 5F.0 — Freeze & Pre-registration
Status: **FROZEN**.

Frozen preregistration set:

- `research/phase5f/THESIS.md`
- `research/phase5f/NON_GOALS.md`
- `research/phase5f/EVALUATION_PROTOCOL.md`
- `research/phase5f/BASELINES.md`
- `research/phase5f/METRICS.md`
- `research/phase5f/KILL_CRITERIA.md`

No scored benchmark result is authorized to modify these documents post hoc.

### 5F.1 — Evaluation Projection & Blind Case Foundation
Status: **CURRENT MILESTONE**.

Build private evaluation-only RAW/MINIMAL/FULL views of identical cases, keep hidden gold physically/logically separate from visible evidence, and establish the first blinded case/export/scoring boundary without modifying frozen Phase-5 behavior.
